# Topic Modeling

A repo for me to futz around with Machine Learning algorithms and subjects related to topic modeling.

### Contents
- `environment.yml`: A [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment file containing
  the requirements for running code in this repository.
- `latent-dirichlet-exercise.ipynb`: A [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Notebook with some basic code looking at how to run and parse the output of scikit-learn's pre-packaged LDA estimator.
